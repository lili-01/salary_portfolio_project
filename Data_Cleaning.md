# Data Cleaning
### Using Google Sheets
For this project I decided to use Google Sheets to clean my data. Google sheets has a built in feature that helps cleaning up your data with a simple button.
Here are the steps I took:
   - I loaded the CSV I obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data) onto Google Sheets. 
   - Once loaded I used the bulit in functions to identify and remove duplicates. (Data> Data Cleaning> Remove Duplicates) In which it reduced the number of duplicates from 6705 to 1792. :astonished:
